# Hangman
This is the classic game of hangman created with react. It can either be played one-player or two-players. Please email me at 3069391@gmail.com or comment on this project page should you have any questions about the game, suggestions for further improvement, or have found any bugs.

## Controls and Features
If you are playing by yourself, it would be most fun to choose the start menu option for a random word, of which you can choose to guess a random food, activity, movie, U.S. state, or U.S. President. If you are playing with two people, then you can either choose a random word and work together or you can play against each other with the opponent typing out a phrase that the guesser has to guess. Once the word or phrase is picked, you can either click the keyboard buttons to pick a letter or type on your computer's keyboard. Watch out, as 6 wrong letter guesses will lose you the game!
